Screening tests
Pregnant women are offered a screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome from 10-14 weeks of pregnancy. This is to assess your chance of having a baby with these conditions.
The screening test offered at 10-14 weeks is called the combined test. It involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan. All women in England are offered screening for Down’s syndrome using this test. Screening for Patau’s and Edwards’ syndromes using the combined test started in 2015 and will be available across England by April 2016.
If you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered other tests.
